# Naive Bayes Classification on Social Network Ads Dataset
This is a simple implementation of Naive Bayes classification algorithm on the social network ads dataset. The goal of this implementation is to predict whether a user will purchase a product based on their age and estimated salary.
## Dataset
The dataset consists of 400 observations with the following columns:

**1-User ID**

**2-Gender (Male=1/Female=0)**

**3-Age (in years)**

**4-Estimated Salary (in dollars)**

**5-Purchased (0=No, 1=Yes)**

We will use the Age and Estimated Salary columns to predict whether a user will purchase a product.

## Rnning the Code

To run the code, follow the steps below:

**1-Download the dataset from the repository above(Social Network Ads.csv).**

**2-Open Google drive and upload the dataset in DATA file, (Make sure that the path in the code corresponds to the dataset placement).**

**3-Open Google Colab and create a new Python 3 notebook and run the code after pasting it.**

## Conclusion

In this project, we used Naive Bayes Classification algorithm to predict whether a user will purchase a product based on their age and estimated salary, using the Social Network Ads dataset. We achieved an accuracy of 90.0% on the testing data.
