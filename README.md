# Naive Bayes Classification on Social Network Ads Dataset
This is a simple implementation of Naive Bayes classification algorithm on the social network ads dataset. The goal of this implementation is to predict whether a user will purchase a product based on their age and estimated salary.
##Dataset
The dataset consists of 400 observations with the following columns:

**1-User ID**

**2-Gender (Male=1/Female=0)**

**3-Age (in years)**

**4-Estimated Salary (in dollars)**

**5-Purchased (0=No, 1=Yes)**

We will use the Age and Estimated Salary columns to predict whether a user will purchase a product.
